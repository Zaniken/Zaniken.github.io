            <h2>Welcome! You’ve made it to my little website. </h2><br>
            <p>My name is Zaniken Gurule, I am a recently graduated computer science student (Dec. 2021), and an aspiring software engineer. I was born and raised in Sandy, Utah on the Wasatch Front. After graduating high school I received a full ride scholarship
                to Southern Utah University where I studied computer science. While I was in school I saw many of my friends switch degrees, but my fascination with computers, programming in particular, remained throughout. I am now very excited to be
                entering a field that is constantly evolving and is ever relevant.
                <br><br>Outside of school and programming some of my interests include: collecting vinyl albums, hiking/backpacking, strategy video games, and traveling. I was raised to appreciate travel; I have been fortunate enough to visit places such
                as Thailand and Costa Rica. Over the past summer I was also able to work in Denali Alaska. I have a few pictures of my travels in my ‘PhotoGallery’.
                <br><br>On my website you can find some of the projects I’ve completed for college as well as my own personal coding projects. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.
