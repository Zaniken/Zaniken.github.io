                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>This was a graduation project to demonstrate the technical skills that I have acquired throughout my bachelor’s degree. In addition, this project contributed to my universities ambitious plan of offering virtual tours in Minecraft.
                        The project consisted of creating a package of software that takes real life images of buildings and converts them into 3d Minecraft models. The project combined concepts from a variety of computer science topics such as algorithms,
                        file structures, and software engineering.</p>
                    <h2>Project Timeline</h2>
                    <img src="images/Timeline.png" width="100%" height=auto>
                    <h2>Main Objectives</h2>
                    <h3>Create an algorithm that calculates the average color of an image.</h3>
                    <p>
                        The need for an algorithm to find average color density was found in two areas, first to find the average color of a Minecraft block. Second, to find the average color density in small sections of images (in this case photos of walls). I was able to find
                        resources on Java’s built-in image manipulation tools that saved a lot of time. I also used Java’s Color classes. The resulting algorithm is a simple double for loop that iterates over each pixel in a buffered image (or section
                        of a buffered image) taking the RGB color values and adding them to their own individual sums. The total sums are then divided by the width*height of the image and returned as their color value or the total average color.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Create an algorithm that can use average color densities of sections of images to find their Minecraft block equivalent.</h3>
                    <p>
                        After getting color averages of blocks and image sections I needed a way to compare two colors. The answer I was looking for was utilizing the distance formula with color values. As colors are represented by their RGB values you can take the square of
                        the intensity of red A minus red B and add that to the same formula for the green and blue values. If colors are very similar the number will be small if they are very different, they will be large. Using this algorithm, I looped
                        through every Minecraft block and compared the color distances, swapping if the distance is lower. This process was used to create a 2d array of Minecraft block equivalents that can be used as individual walls.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/demo.PNG" width="100%" height=auto>
                    <p>This is a demonstration of an image being converted into its average-color-tile representation and then into its Minecraft block equivalent. This was done using my software.</p>
                    <h3>Be able to trace the outline of a building from a google maps screenshot to get the dimensions of a building</h3>
                    <p>
                        A goal of mine was to have the scale of buildings translate to Minecraft I found that a one-to-one ratio looked bad and settled on a 5 to 1 meaning one meter in real life would be 5 meters in Minecraft (1 block = 1 meter). For the sides of my generated
                        building to be the correct length and be to scale I require the importing of a google maps image of the building. Google maps provides a meter bar that can be used to measure the building. I take a user text entry of the meter
                        scale number and then have them click each end of the meter bar. Separate from the GUI these inputs calculate the number of pixels on the image that would equal 1 meter. With this information I can then have the user outline the
                        building clicking on each corner in a clockwise manner. The building dimensions are then stored with their corresponding wall number. At this point it is of note that my software is only capable of converting rectangular shaped
                        buildings due to the exponential number of variables of non-rectangular buildings and my own time and energy constraints.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Convert the processed information into the schematic file type that is usable by 3rd party Minecraft building software</h3>
                    <p>I now had the problem of knowing what blocks each of my building walls were going to be made of in addition to the size of each wall, but I had no way of making that in Minecraft. I ended up researching and reverse engineering the
                        file types used by Minecraft and its third-party software. NBT is a custom file type created for Minecraft to store block data and location data, WorldEdit (a 3 rd party world editing software for Minecraft, the tool I used to
                        paste my processed buildings into Minecraft), uses their own version of an NBT file called “.schematics”; there is very little documentation on WorldEdit’s schematic file type and to make things more confusing other Minecraft editing
                        software have their own incompatible versions of schematics. To replicate the files made by WorldEdit in my own software I used file analysis techniques including creating files using their software and analyzing them with a hex
                        editor gaining an understanding of the general file structure and deconstructing the WorldEdit source code and isolating the relevant code. I also took advantage of JNBT which is a Java library that handles the actual writing of
                        the NBT file, but not the file structure. I was able to compare the files I was making with JNBT with WorldEdit’s own schematic files until they eventually matched and were compatible.
